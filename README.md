## Features

#### Using Compiled Binaries
Compiled binaries and a helper for flashing are available in directory /compiledbin. On Windows you can use "flash.bat" it will ask you which COM port that ESP is connected and then flashes it. You can use any flashing tool and do the flashing manually. The flashing process itself has been described at numerous places on Internet.
